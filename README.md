# WannaWatchThat - app

Welcome to my graduation project!

## Description

This app has been envisioned as a movie database with the ability to register as a user and have your own lists of movies that you plan to watch and that you have watched already. There are several pages, each showing currently trending media (movies and TV shows) and also a search page. Users have access to Dashboard only when they are logged in. On the dashboard they can see their lists of media - whether the ones they plan to watch, or the media they have finished watching.

The app itself uses the colors picked on the https://colorhunt.co/, while ChakraUI provides components for the rest of the app.

Application itself is fully responsive on all screen sizes.

## Installing

This project has been made primarily with React+Vite. In order for it to run, you will need to download or clone the files from the github. I recommend using the master branch for this.

Once you have downloaded them, you will need to run the following command:
-npm install.

This will add the missing modules that are necessary for the app to work.
You will also need the .env file which contains the API keys for relevant API calls.

Please contact me directly if you need the .env

## Technologies used in the app

- HTML
- CSS
- React
- Vite
- ChakraUI

## Acknowledgments

My thanks goes first and foremost to my mentor Stefan Djikic, as well as to my classmate and friends Djordje Arandjelovic, Stefan Kuburovic and Aleksandar Cakic for their advices and patience.

Finally, for all her support throught the entire duration of the course as well as making this graduation app, I would like to thank my wife, Dragana Velickovic. Without her, I am pretty sure this wouldn't have been possible.
